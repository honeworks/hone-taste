# Implement a change

1. Re-read the accepted change record (if any) and the `design/current.md` sections it changes.
2. **Tests first.** Write the tests and watch them fail for the expected reason:
   - each new acceptance case as `tests/e2e/test_ac<N>_<slug>.py`, public API or CLI only, and it must
     fail if the feature is removed;
   - unit tests for edge cases and each error path; contract tests (`tests/contract/`) if a port changed;
   - a test that reopens what is stored (stores, caches, files) when what is written changes;
   - for a bug: a test that reproduces it (`debug-failure`).
3. **Implement** the smallest code that passes, within CONTRIBUTING.md "Keep it simple" and "Code
   conventions". The core imports no extra; errors are `HoneTasteError` subclasses from
   `src/hone_taste/errors.py` with messages that say what to do.
4. Fast loop while working: `uv run pytest -x -q <paths>`, `uv run ruff check .`, `uv run pyright`.
5. Commit each green step as a small Conventional Commit; the body says why.
6. Run `sync-docs`, then `verify-before-done`.
7. Report to the user: what changed, which tests prove it, anything left open. Then wait for "push" /
   "ship it" / "I'm happy", which starts `open-pr`.
