description: Find the cause of a bug, a failing test or a wrong result before changing code - reproduce, read the evidence, test one hypothesis at a time, fix the cause, keep a regression test. Use for any bug report, test failure or unexpected behaviour.

# Debug a failure

1. **Reproduce** with the smallest command: one test (`uv run pytest <path>::<test> -x -vv`) or a
   short script.
2. **Read the evidence before guessing:**
   - the full traceback and the error message;
   - the spans: `.hone/taste/spans.db` (`HONE_HOME`), `docs/records.md`;
   - the score's `error` when it is `None`, and the scorer's inputs;
   - `hone-taste score` on the same input from the command line (`docs/cli.md`);
   - `git log -p` of the code involved.
3. **Write a failing test** that reproduces the bug before fixing it.
4. **One hypothesis at a time.** Say what you expect to see if it's true, check it, change one thing.
5. **Fix the cause**, not the symptom. Never loosen a test, catch and ignore an error, or add a retry to
   hide it.
6. If the cause is a design gap, note it in `design/decisions.md` or start a `plan-change`.
7. Commit as `fix: ...` with the cause and the fix in the body.
